# REPOSITORY CLEANUP COMPLETE

Removed all conflicting old authentication files to prevent CDN conflicts.

## What was removed:
- `/auth-system/` folder (old conflicting files)
- `/niko-pim-auth/` folder (old webpack builds)
- `niko-pim-simple.js` (conflicting v3.0 file)
- All debug and test files

## What remains:
- `niko-auth-core.min.js` - The ONLY authentication file (v2.0 with correct API key)
- Documentation files
- Supabase edge functions
- Webflow CMS integration

CDN URL to use: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jerops/nikobathrooms@main/niko-auth-core.min.js

This should now load cleanly without conflicts.
