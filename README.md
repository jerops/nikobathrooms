## 🚀 Components

### 🔐 PIM Authentication System (`niko-pim-auth/`)
**FULLY IMPLEMENTED** - Advanced authentication system for Product Information Management (PIM) integration.

**✅ Completed Features:**
- ✅ Secure environment-based configuration
- ✅ Complete user authentication flow
- ✅ Role-based access control (Customer/Retailer)
- ✅ Automatic user role determination
- ✅ Smart redirect logic to appropriate dashboards
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Real-time authentication state management
- ✅ Secure session management
- ✅ Testing environment with proper UI

**Tech Stack:**
- JavaScript ES6+ with modern async/await patterns
- Webpack with environment variable support
- Babel for browser compatibility
- ESLint for code quality
- Jest for testing

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### **Prerequisites**
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager
- Supabase account for authentication backend

### **1. Environment Setup**

Navigate to the authentication system:
```bash
cd niko-pim-auth
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

Create environment file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local` with your credentials:
```env
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
WEBFLOW_SITE_ID=your-site-id
# ... other variables
```

### **2. Development**

Build for development:
```bash
npm run build:dev
```

Start development server:
```bash
npm start
```

Run tests:
```bash
npm test
```

### **3. Testing**

Open the secure test interface:
```bash
# After building, open in browser:
open test-auth-secure.html
```

### **4. Production Build**

Build for production:
```bash
npm run build
```

This creates optimized files in the `dist/` folder ready for deployment.
