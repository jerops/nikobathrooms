## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### **Prerequisites**
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager
- Supabase account for authentication backend

### **1. Environment Setup**

Navigate to the authentication system:
```bash
cd niko-pim-auth
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

Create environment file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local` with your credentials:
```env
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
WEBFLOW_SITE_ID=your-site-id
# ... other variables
```

### **2. Development**

Build for development:
```bash
npm run build:dev
```

Start development server:
```bash
npm start
```

Run tests:
```bash
npm test
```

### **3. View Transitions Setup**

Navigate to view transitions:
```bash
cd view-transitions
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

Build production files:
```bash
npm run build
```

### **4. Testing**

Open the secure test interface:
```bash
# After building, open in browser:
open test-auth-secure.html
```

For view transitions testing:
```bash
# Open integration example
open view-transitions/examples/webflow-integration.html
```

### **5. Production Build**

Build for production:
```bash
npm run build
```

This creates optimized files in the `dist/` folder ready for deployment.
